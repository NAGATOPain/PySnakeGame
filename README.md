# PySnakeGame

This game is my first game which uses PyGame Library.
It contains 3 file: main, food.py and snake.py
- "main" is the main file, contains game init, main loop, etc. It's the most important file in this game
- "food.py" is the file having Food class, contains all attributes of the food in this game
- "snake.py" is the file having Snake class, which is our main character, and, of course, contains all attributes of the snake in this game.
All of explans have already been contained in comment in files, just check it up.
Thanks
