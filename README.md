# PySnakeGame

This one is my first game which uses PyGame Library.
It contains 3 file: main, food.py and snake.py:
- "main" is the main file, contains game init, main loop, etc. It's the most important file in this game.
- "food.py" is the file having Food class, contains all attributes of the food in this game.
- "snake.py" is the file having Snake class, which has our main character - Snake, and, of course, contains all attributes of the snake in this game.

All of explains have already been contained in comment in files, so just check it up.
Thanks.
